## Compilation

### Using the script (recommended)

```bash
./build.sh
```
or

```bash
bash build.sh
```

### Using CMake

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

## Usage
- Start the server
```bash
./zappy_server -p <port> -x <width> -y <height> -n <team> [<team>] [<team>] [<team>] ... -c <nb> -f <freq>
```
- Start the graphical client
```bash
./zappy_gui -p <port> -h <hostname>
```
- Start the AI
```bash
./zappy_ai -p <port> -n <team> -h <hostname>
```
If everything is working, you should see a window with a map and maybe more.
- Start a netcat client
```bash
nc <ip> <port>
```
You should receive a "WELCOME" message. If you want to connect as a GUI, You are invited to enter ``GRAPHICAL``. Otherwise, please enter the team name of your AI. Then, you can use the adapted protocol.

By default, the local ip is ``127.0.0.1`` and the port is ``4242``. The default team names are ``Team1``, ``Team2``, ``Team3`` and ``Team4``.

## GUI Controls
